Notes:	values are number per 100 m3 and 10 m2											
	taxa were selected based on time series mean abundance > 100 per 100 m3 and occurrence in greater than 5% of samples; requests for the inclusion of other taxa in future versions will be considered (contact jon.hare@noaa.gov)											
	upon review of the characteristics of tows, some stations included in 100M3 calculations was omitted from 10M2 calculations											
	time is Greenwich Mean Time											
	We are in the process of converting and consolidating database systems that store Plankton data from various sources, some historical corrections have been made and have resulted in minor changes to the historical data for approximately 0.01% of the stations.Â  We expect these processing changes to speed the availability of data and increase the amount of data available for analysis											
	As part of the database consolidation cruise naming has been standardized, cruises previously designated DLxxxx are now DExxxx.
